# backman
A simple utility that changes your background, that also likes to segfault.
You can install it by `git clone`ing this repo to some location, then run `make make-install` to install it, assuming you have GCC, X11 and Imlib2 installed.

## Avaliable make commands:
`make [default]`: compiles the program  
`make install`: installs the program to `~/.local/bin/`  
`make make-install`: compiles and installs  

## Why does it like to segfault?
Because I was the one writing the code.

## How do I use it?
For usage, you can simply input `backman` into the terminal.
